You only need to be concerned   with the files specified above
7. Create the run analysis script following the objectives specified and name it "run_analysis.R".
8. Output of R script should be written to a file "tidy.csv" which needs to be uploaded to Github Repo.

The details of step 7 is specified in the codebook.

Enjoy..
